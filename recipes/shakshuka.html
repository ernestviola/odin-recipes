      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Shakshuka (or shakshouka) is a traditional Tunisian dish featuring poached eggs in a spicy tomato sauce with onions, bell pepper, and garlic.</p>
      <p>I sometimes throw whatever I have available into the dish but the essentials are tomato and eggs.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced bell peppers</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 hot chile pepper, seeded and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of groud cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Mix in all of your vegetables that you want to cook except for the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Throw in your mixed dry ingredients into the skillet and let the vegetables simmer for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in your tomato mixture and make sure to mix while scrapping off any of the stuck parts at the bottom of the skillet.</li>
        <li>After the tomato juices have reduced make 4 pockets in the shakshuka and crack your eggs into them. Cover the skillet for a few minutes to let the eggs cook. This is also a great time to add some cheese.</li>
        <li>After about 4 minutes take it off the stove and bring it to the table. It's great to have with some bread.</li>
