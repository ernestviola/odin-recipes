        <li>Bring to boil 3 quarts of water with salt. Add rice and stir for 7 minutes. Drain</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Cover bottom of the pot with 1 layer of potato slices. Sprinkle cumin and salt over potatoes. Cook until potatoes are sizzling, 2 to 3 minutes; top potatoes with rice to form an even layer. Reduce heat to low and place butter slices over rice.</li>

        <li>Grind saffron threads with a mortar and pestle. Mix crushed saffron with 1 ½ tablespoons hot water in a large bowl. Add a couple of spoonfuls of rice to saffron mixture and stir until rice is yellow.</li>
        <li>Spoon remaining rice into a serving bowl. Top with saffron rice and line the edges of the bowl with potatoes. Garnish with parsley.</li>
